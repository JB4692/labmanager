MUST HAVES:
    make the submissions save in the database
    make a submission class & builder (? :o)
    adjust the gui margins a bit
    fix the create analyst, test and remove analyst, test 
    add a way to query for submissions by certain attributes

Nice to have:
    make the UI nicer
    add in multiple components per test support
    add roles to users (subclass or another attribute? :o)
